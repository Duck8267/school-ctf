  "description": "Every website is built with HTML code that you can see! Sometimes secrets are hidden right in the page source.\n\nYour task: I've hidden a secret message in an HTML comment on this very challenge page! Can you find it?\n\nSTEPS:\n1. Right-click anywhere on this page\n2. Select 'View Page Source' (or press Ctrl+U / Cmd+Option+U)\n3. Look through the HTML for a comment - it starts with <!-- and ends with -->\n4. Find the hidden password inside the comment\n5. Submit it as FLAG{password_you_found}\n\nHINT: HTML comments are used by developers to leave notes in their code. They won't show up on the visible page, only in the source code!",
