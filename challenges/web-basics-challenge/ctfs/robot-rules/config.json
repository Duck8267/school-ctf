  "description": "Websites have a special file called 'robots.txt' that tells search engine robots which pages they can visit! Sometimes interesting directories are listed there.\n\nYour task: Check the robots.txt file of THIS website to find a secret path!\n\nSTEPS:\n1. Look at the URL of this page in your browser\n2. Remove everything after the domain name\n3. Add /robots.txt to the end\n4. For example: if you're on 'example.com/challenge/123', go to 'example.com/robots.txt'\n5. Find the comment that says 'Secret path:' and look at what follows it\n6. Submit it as FLAG{path_you_found}\n\nNOTE: Real websites use robots.txt to tell search engines what to index. Hackers often check this file first to discover hidden directories!",
