  "description": "The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.\n\nYour task: Decode the following encrypted message:\n\nzhoogrqhwhdp\n\nHint: Try different shift values! The flag format is FLAG{decrypted_text}",
